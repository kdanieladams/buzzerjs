# Buzzer.js Server

Simple buzzer app for debates.  This is the server-side app, written in Express.js.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
This requires the client to be running in a different console window.
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
This serves the built client from a static directory (`/www`), so no need to run the client seperately.
```
npm start
```
